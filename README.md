##  Project Overview

This project, titled **<To-Do List Web App>**, was built as my final submission for **CS50x 2025**.
It is a **web-based To-Do List application** that allows users to manage their daily tasks in a simple, intuitive, and responsive environment.

The application demonstrates my ability to work with:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and logic
- **LocalStorage** to persist tasks between sessions

The purpose of this project is to create a **practical, user-friendly productivity tool** that also serves as a demonstration of my foundational skills in **frontend web development**.


## Project Purpose

In our daily lives, itâ€™s easy to lose track of small or large tasks. A simple To-Do List app helps individuals:
- Stay organized
- Track progress
- Mark completed tasks
- Remove items when no longer needed

The **main goals** of this project were:
1. To practice integrating **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in a cohesive project.
2. To implement **dynamic updates to the DOM** (adding, editing, deleting tasks).
3. To use **LocalStorage** so that user data persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.
4. To design a **responsive interface** so the app works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


##  File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

â”€ index.html # Main entry point of the app (structure of the page)
â”€ style.css # Stylesheet for layout, colors, and responsiveness
â”€ script.js # JavaScript logic (adding, deleting, completing tasks)
â”€ README.md # Documentation file (this file)


### Explanation of Files

- **index.html**
  Provides the structure of the app. It contains:
  - An input box for new tasks
  - A button to add tasks
  - A section where tasks are displayed dynamically

- **style.css**
  Defines the appearance of the app. Includes:
  - Clean and modern UI design
  - Highlighting of completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough effect)
  - Mobile responsiveness with flexible layouts

- **script.js**
  Contains the core logic. Handles:
  - Adding new tasks
  - Marking tasks as complete
  - Deleting tasks
  - Storing tasks in **LocalStorage**
  - Loading tasks from **LocalStorage** when the app starts

- **README.md**
  Explains the project, its purpose, file structure, and usage instructions.

##  How to Access and Run the Project

You can access the live project directly in two ways:

1. **GitHub Repository**
   Visit the GitHub repository for the source code:
    [https://github.com/Aarif195/cs50-Project]

2. **Local Machine Setup**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Aarif195/cs50-Project.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd <cs50-Project>
     ```
   - Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - Or, to run with a local server, use:
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```
     Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Design Choices

- **Minimalist UI**: Chose a simple, distraction-free design so that users focus on their tasks.
- **Responsiveness**: CSS media queries ensure the app adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **LocalStorage**: Instead of requiring a backend or database, LocalStorage provides persistence with minimal complexity.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript was used for real-time interactivity, allowing tasks to appear, update, and disappear without reloading the page.
- **Accessibility**: Ensured that buttons and inputs are easily clickable and keyboard-accessible.

##  Future Improvements

While the project currently fulfills its core purpose, there are several features I would like to add in the future:
- Ability to **edit tasks** after adding them.
- Categorization of tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).
- Dark mode toggle for better accessibility at night.
- Synchronization with an online database so tasks are available across multiple devices.

##  Conclusion

The **<To-Do List Web App>** project represents my effort to combine what Iâ€™ve learned in **CS50x** about problem solving and software development with practical web technologies.

By working on this, I practiced:
- Structuring a project with multiple files
- Writing clean, reusable code
- Using version control (GitHub) for project sharing
- Documenting my work clearly for others to understand

This project was both a **learning journey** and a **useful tool**, and I am proud to submit it as my final project for CS50x 2025.
